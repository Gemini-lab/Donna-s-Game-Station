**Description**
Donna is facing new competition. She believes her competitor is impacting the gallons of gas she sells. To find out she hired a data analyst to help understand the effects of her competitor’s prices on the total gallons sold she sold on the same days.  

**Business Problem**
The problem is what price Donna can set to boost her overall sales while beating her competitor. Her competitor likely does the same and if not she should do so first and collect more data in the long run.
Propose Outcome
The expected outcome in analyzing the data allows us to predict the timing of her competitor’s prices possibly weeks beforehand to better plan to increase Donna’s gas sales without losing revenue and customers. 

**How can Sales improve?**
Donna seeks to improve her sales at her gas station in hopes of beating her competitor. While competition is good as it provides more options to the customer, Donna is a producer and her competitor will compete with customers. The one with the most sales is likely to be the gas station that turns a profit

**The Data**
The data consists of Donna’s prices, competitors' prices, and the gallons of gas Donna sold per day for the past eight weeks. The analysis will show how Donna’s prices and her competitors' prices affect her overall gallons sold per day. 

**What to Expect?**
